## Description

This is a portfolio site for myself hosted using Netlify and built using React and TailwindCSS. It was built to showcase my skills in web design and development, display some projects I have worked on, and link my resume, so I can use it in a professional capacity!

Navigate through the site using the navigation bar. You can check out the about me page, my portfolio, a contact form(this is currently not funtional, but will be fixed in future updates), and my resume. You can also check out the links to my socials in the footer. 
Note that the contact form will only accept submissions with a valid email address and all fields inputted.
Additionally, this site was created to be responsive - feel free to check it out on a mobile device.
